# zCoin Deployment Safety Guidelines

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### **Before Any Deployment**

1. **Test on Testnet First**
   - Always deploy and test on testnet before mainnet
   - Verify all functionality works as expected
   - Test upgrade system thoroughly

2. **Keypair Security**
   - Use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments
   - Never commit private keys to repository
   - Use separate keypairs for different environments
   - Backup keypairs securely

3. **Environment Validation**
   - Verify all environment variables are correct
   - Double-check RPC endpoints
   - Confirm program IDs match expected values

### **Testnet Deployment Safety**

#### **Pre-Deployment Checks**
- [ ] Environment variables validated
- [ ] Keypairs exist and are accessible
- [ ] RPC connection working
- [ ] Sufficient SOL balance (minimum 1 SOL)
- [ ] Program builds successfully

#### **During Deployment**
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Verify program deployment
- [ ] Check config account creation
- [ ] Validate mint creation
- [ ] Confirm initialization success

#### **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Verify upgrade system
- [ ] Check all PDAs created correctly

### **Mainnet Deployment Safety**

#### **Pre-Deployment Checks**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Tested on testnet first
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All keypairs are hardware wallets
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Multisig setup for upgrade authority
- [ ] Environment variables validated
- [ ] RPC connection working
- [ ] Sufficient SOL balance (minimum 5 SOL)
- [ ] Program builds successfully
- [ ] Old mint exists on mainnet
- [ ] Old mint is valid pump.fun token

#### **During Deployment**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Confirm mainnet deployment
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Verify program deployment
- [ ] Check config account creation
- [ ] Validate mint creation
- [ ] Confirm initialization success

#### **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Verify upgrade system
- [ ] Check all PDAs created correctly
- [ ] Generate deployment report

### **Upgrade Authority Security**

#### **Multisig Requirements**
- Use multisig wallet for upgrade authority
- Minimum 3 signers for mainnet
- Require 2/3 or 3/5 signatures
- Use hardware wallets for signers

#### **Timelock Settings**
- Minimum 7 days for mainnet upgrades
- 3 days for testnet upgrades
- Community notification before timelock expires

### **Emergency Procedures**

#### **If Deployment Fails**
1. Stop deployment immediately
2. Check error logs
3. Verify environment setup
4. Fix issues and retry
5. Never retry without understanding the failure

#### **If Program Deployed Incorrectly**
1. **DO NOT** attempt to fix on mainnet
2. Deploy new program with correct configuration
3. Migrate users to new program
4. Document the issue

#### **If Upgrade Authority Compromised**
1. Immediately pause migration
2. Deploy new program version
3. Migrate all tokens and liquidity
4. Update community

### **Monitoring and Alerts**

#### **Deployment Monitoring**
- Monitor program account
- Check config account state
- Verify mint authorities
- Monitor token supplies

#### **Security Monitoring**
- Monitor upgrade authority
- Check for unauthorized transactions
- Verify timelock compliance
- Monitor community feedback

### **Documentation Requirements**

#### **Deployment Reports**
- Generate deployment report after each deployment
- Include all addresses and configurations
- Document any issues or deviations
- Store reports securely

#### **Change Logs**
- Document all changes made
- Include reasoning for changes
- Track version history
- Maintain audit trail

### **Community Communication**

#### **Before Mainnet Deployment**
- Announce deployment plan
- Share testnet results
- Explain upgrade system
- Set expectations

#### **During Deployment**
- Provide real-time updates
- Share deployment progress
- Address any concerns
- Maintain transparency

#### **After Deployment**
- Confirm successful deployment
- Share deployment report
- Provide next steps
- Answer questions

### **Recovery Procedures**

#### **Backup Strategies**
- Backup all keypairs
- Store deployment reports
- Document all configurations
- Maintain version history

#### **Disaster Recovery**
- Have recovery procedures ready
- Test recovery procedures
- Maintain emergency contacts
- Document recovery steps
